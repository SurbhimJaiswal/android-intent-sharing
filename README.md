# Sharing sounds to SoundCloud via intents

This is a small sample app to demonstrate how you could integrate SoundCloud in your
own Android application. You can record some audio and then upload it to
SoundCloud with the official Android app (which must be installed).

See [Android Sharing Kit][] for more information.
